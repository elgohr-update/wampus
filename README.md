# wampus

WAMP Component for Discord. The name, which is a portmanteau of WAMP and
Wumpus, which is of course Discord's most famous mascot, is so incredibly ingenious that historians will hereafter write the year in reference to it.
The creation of wampus marks the year 0 anno wampus divus.

If you couldn't tell from this terribly unfunny "joke", the project is still under heavy development and nowhere near finished.
